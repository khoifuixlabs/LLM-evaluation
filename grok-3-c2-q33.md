To address the query, we need to construct a scenario in a sliding window algorithm where the sender window size (SWS) and receiver window size (RWS) are both 3, and the maximum sequence number (MaxSeqNum) is 5. In this setup, sequence numbers range from 0 to 4 and wrap around, so the sequence number for the Nth packet, DATA[N], is N mod 5. The goal is to find a sequence of events where the receiver expects DATA[5] (which has sequence number 5 mod 5 = 0) but mistakenly accepts DATA[0] (which also has sequence number 0 mod 5 = 0) due to sequence number ambiguity, while ensuring that packets arrive in the order they were sent.

### Understanding the Sliding Window Algorithm

In the sliding window protocol, the sender can have up to SWS=3 unacknowledged packets outstanding, and the receiver can accept up to RWS=3 packets within its window. Here, we assume a Selective Repeat mechanism, as it allows the receiver to accept packets within its window (up to RWS positions ahead of the earliest unacknowledged packet), even if some prior packets are missing, although the constraint "no packets may arrive out of order" implies packets are delivered in the sequence sent. Sequence numbers cycle from 0 to 4, so DATA[0] has seq=0, DATA[1] has seq=1, DATA[2] has seq=2, DATA[3] has seq=3, DATA[4] has seq=4, and DATA[5] has seq=0 again.

The challenge arises because MaxSeqNum=5 is less than SWS + RWS = 3 + 3 = 6, violating the typical requirement for Selective Repeat that MaxSeqNum ≥ SWS + RWS to prevent ambiguity between old and new packets with the same sequence number.

### Constructing the Scenario

We need the receiver to expect DATA[5] (seq=0) but accept a retransmitted DATA[0] (seq=0) instead. Since packets arrive in order, the sequence of packets received matches the order sent, including any retransmissions. Let’s assume acknowledgments (ACKs) are per packet (not cumulative) for simplicity, though the scenario can adapt to cumulative ACKs with appropriate losses.

Here’s a step-by-step scenario:

1. **Initial Transmission:**

   - Sender sends: DATA[0] (seq=0), DATA[1] (seq=1), DATA[2] (seq=2), utilizing its full window (SWS=3).
   - Receiver receives DATA[0], sends ACK[0], and shifts its window to expect seq=1, 2, 3 (positions for DATA[1], DATA[2], DATA[3]).
   - Receiver receives DATA[1], sends ACK[1], window shifts to seq=2, 3, 4 (for DATA[2], DATA[3], DATA[4]).
   - Receiver receives DATA[2], sends ACK[2], window shifts to seq=3, 4, 0 (for DATA[3], DATA[4], DATA[5]), since 5 mod 5 = 0.

   At this point, the receiver has delivered DATA[0], DATA[1], and DATA[2] to the application, and its window is poised to accept DATA[3] (seq=3), DATA[4] (seq=4), and DATA[5] (seq=0).

2. **Retransmission Trigger:**

   - Suppose ACK[0] is lost, but ACK[1] and ACK[2] reach the sender.
   - Sender receives ACK[1] and ACK[2], sliding its window to allow new packets, but the timer for DATA[0] expires due to the lost ACK[0].
   - Sender retransmits DATA[0] (seq=0).

3. **Receiver Accepts Retransmitted Packet:**

   - Since packets arrive in the order sent, the network delivers the retransmitted DATA[0] next (after DATA[2], before any subsequent packets like DATA[3]).
   - Receiver gets DATA[0] (seq=0). Its current window is seq=3, 4, 0, so seq=0 is within the window.
   - In Selective Repeat, the receiver accepts any packet within its window and buffers it at the corresponding sequence number position. Thus, it accepts this DATA[0] (seq=0) and places it in the slot for seq=0, interpreting it as DATA[5], which it expects to have seq=0.

4. **Outcome:**
   - The receiver has now accepted the retransmitted DATA[0] as if it were DATA[5], fulfilling the query’s requirement. It expects DATA[5] but accepts DATA[0] due to the identical sequence number (0).
   - Subsequent packets, like DATA[3] (seq=3) sent after the retransmission, would arrive next and be accepted as DATA[3], consistent with in-order delivery.

### Verification

- **Window Positions:** After receiving DATA[0], DATA[1], DATA[2], the receiver’s window correctly advances to 3, 4, 0, expecting DATA[5] at seq=0.
- **In-Order Delivery:** The packets arrive as sent: DATA[0], DATA[1], DATA[2], then retransmitted DATA[0], maintaining the order of transmission.
- **Confusion Cause:** With MaxSeqNum=5 < 6, the sequence numbers wrap around too soon, allowing DATA[0] and DATA[5] to share seq=0, causing ambiguity resolvable only with MaxSeqNum ≥ 6.

### Scenario Summary

The sender sends DATA[0], DATA[1], and DATA[2]. The receiver acknowledges them, advancing its window to expect sequence numbers 3, 4, 0 (for DATA[3], DATA[4], DATA[5]). Due to a lost ACK[0], the sender retransmits DATA[0] (seq=0), which arrives next. The receiver, with window 3, 4, 0, accepts this DATA[0] as DATA[5], mistaking it due to the shared sequence number.

This demonstrates how the algorithm becomes confused, highlighting why MaxSeqNum ≥ 6 is necessary to ensure sufficient unique sequence numbers to distinguish packets across the combined sender and receiver windows.
