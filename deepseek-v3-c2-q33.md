### Understanding the Problem

Before diving into solving the problem, it's crucial to understand the key components involved:

1. **Sliding Window Protocol**: This is a method used in networking to manage the flow of packets between sender and receiver, ensuring reliable data transfer.

2. **SWS (Sender Window Size) and RWS (Receiver Window Size)**: Both are set to 3 in this scenario. This means the sender can have up to 3 unacknowledged packets in transit, and the receiver can buffer up to 3 packets.

3. **MaxSeqNum (Maximum Sequence Number)**: Set to 5, meaning sequence numbers range from 0 to 4, and then wrap around.

4. **DATA[N]**: Represents the Nth packet, with its sequence number field containing N mod 5.

The core issue is to find a scenario where the receiver expects DATA[5] but mistakenly accepts DATA[0] because they share the same sequence number due to the modulo operation, leading to confusion.

### Breaking Down the Constraints

- **No packets arrive out of order**: This means packets are received in the exact sequence they were sent.
- **MaxSeqNum ≥ 6 is necessary and sufficient**: This suggests that with MaxSeqNum = 5, the protocol can become confused, but increasing it to 6 resolves the issue.

### Visualizing the Scenario

To better grasp the problem, let's visualize the sequence numbers and how they wrap around:

```
Sequence Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, ...
```

Given that MaxSeqNum = 5, after DATA[4], the next packet DATA[5] will have a sequence number of 0 (since 5 mod 5 = 0).

### Identifying the Confusion Point

The confusion arises when:

1. The receiver is expecting DATA[5], which has a sequence number of 0.
2. However, DATA[0] also has a sequence number of 0.
3. If the receiver accepts DATA[0] thinking it's DATA[5], it leads to incorrect data interpretation.

### Constructing the Confusing Scenario

Let's construct a step-by-step scenario where this confusion occurs:

1. **Sender sends DATA[0] to DATA[4]**:

   - DATA[0]: SeqNum = 0
   - DATA[1]: SeqNum = 1
   - DATA[2]: SeqNum = 2
   - DATA[3]: SeqNum = 3
   - DATA[4]: SeqNum = 4

2. **Receiver receives and acknowledges these packets**:

   - The receiver's window slides as it receives each packet.

3. **Sender sends DATA[5]**:

   - DATA[5]: SeqNum = 0 (since 5 mod 5 = 0)

4. **Receiver expects DATA[5] with SeqNum = 0**:

   - However, due to the window size and sequence number wrap-around, the receiver might still have DATA[0] in its buffer.

5. **Receiver accepts DATA[0] instead of DATA[5]**:
   - Both have SeqNum = 0, leading to confusion.

### Why Increasing MaxSeqNum to 6 Helps

With MaxSeqNum = 6:

- Sequence numbers range from 0 to 5.
- DATA[5]: SeqNum = 5
- DATA[6]: SeqNum = 0

Now, when the receiver expects DATA[5], it looks for SeqNum = 5, which is unique and doesn't overlap with DATA[0]'s SeqNum = 0. This prevents the confusion.

### Final Answer

**Confusing Scenario Example:**

1. **Sender transmits packets DATA[0] to DATA[4]** with sequence numbers 0 to 4, respectively.
2. **Receiver receives and acknowledges these packets**, advancing its window.
3. **Sender then sends DATA[5]**, which has a sequence number of 0 (5 mod 5).
4. **Receiver, expecting DATA[5] with SeqNum = 0**, might still have DATA[0] in its buffer due to the window size.
5. **Receiver mistakenly accepts DATA[0] as DATA[5]**, because both share the same sequence number, leading to protocol confusion.

**Resolution:**

By increasing **MaxSeqNum to 6**, sequence numbers become 0 to 5. Now, DATA[5] has a unique sequence number of 5, distinct from DATA[0]'s sequence number of 0. This ensures that the receiver can differentiate between DATA[0] and DATA[5], eliminating the confusion.

Thus, **MaxSeqNum ≥ 6 is both necessary and sufficient** to prevent the sliding window algorithm from becoming confused in this scenario.
